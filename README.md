# ApiAutomationWithGauge

## Project Description

This project is a sample automation framework designed to test user APIs. It leverages the Gauge framework and RestAssured library to execute various positive and negative test scenarios.

---

## Technologies and Dependencies

The following technologies and libraries are used in this project:

- **Java**: For writing test scenarios.
- **Maven**: For project setup and dependency management.
- **Gauge**: For BDD-based test automation.
- **RestAssured**: For making HTTP requests in API testing.
- **Jackson**: For JSON parsing and manipulation.
- **AssertJ**: A powerful assertion library for validations.

## Test Scope

The following APIs and test cases are covered:

### 1. Create User
- Successfully create a user.
- Create a user with missing fields (3 cases).
- Create a user with incorrect data types (6 cases: special characters, numbers, and letters).
- Create a user with values out of restrictions (6 cases: excessively long/short values).

### 2. Get User List
- Successfully retrieve the user list.

### 3. Get User By ID
- Successfully retrieve a user by ID.
- Retrieve a user with an invalid ID.

### 4. Remove User
- Successfully remove a user.
- Attempt to remove an already removed user.

### 5. Switch User Activity
- Successfully switch activity from `true` to `true`.
- Successfully switch activity from `true` to `false`.

### 6. Update User Info
- Successfully update user information.
